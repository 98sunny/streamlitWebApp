# streamlitWebApp
This repo contains some of my work in StreamLit library. It is a Python library that allows us to create a web app interface for the Python Data Science projects.
I also use some other commmonly used Python library to play around. These libraries are numPy, Pandas, yfinance (which is developed by Yahoo!), matplotlib, to name a few.
